- The description of the labels is as follows:
  - **Expected:** Widely accepted, aligned with cultural norms in Iran.
  - **Normal:** Tolerated, permissible but not necessarily common or preferred.
  - **Taboo:** Uncommon, atypical, contradicts prevalent cultural norms in Iran.

## Data Statistics

The dataset contains 1,699 samples. The distribution of labels is as follows:
- **Expected:** 44.9%
- **Normal:** 31.1%
- **Taboo:** 24%

## Data Construction

The data was constructed using large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering techniques. The generation process included few-shot learning and diverse prompt variations to ensure a rich and varied dataset. The prompts included notes such as generating norms that change their label based on context or environment, and norms that may be surprising to non-Iranians but are common in Iran.

Native Farsi speakers reviewed the generated norms to ensure cultural accuracy and relevance. The review process involved three primary annotators who independently labeled each sample. 

## Translation to English

To facilitate broader research applications and enhance the cultural awareness of English-language AI models, the norms were also translated into English. This translation enables cross-cultural comparisons and helps develop more inclusive AI systems. 

## Usage

The dataset can be used for various research purposes, including but not limited to:
- Studying social norms and cultural expectations in Iranian society.
- Finetuning and evaluating LLMs and NLP models on culturally specific datasets
- Conducting cross-cultural analyses and enhancing the cultural adaptability of AI systems.
